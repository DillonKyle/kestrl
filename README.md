# Kestrl - Programming Language

So far this is just working through Rober Nystrom's "Crafting Interpreters" book
and using rust to build out the Interpreter.

The scripts will use a .kst file extension (short for Kestrl), but not even that
is set in stone.

Ive got a scanner and parser that are working so far, but this is still early stages.

The scope of this project is currently "Am I capable of making a basic language".
As I go along learning more about the language, I will better define what this
language should do and how its use would be beneficial (doubt it lol).

## Test Scripts

### haiku.kst

This is a simple script that will serve as completion of the first milestone,
once the interpreter can utilize it properly

### working.kst

This is a test of some working capabilities of the language as I build them out.
